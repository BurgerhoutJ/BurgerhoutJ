### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, 

I'm Jeroen, and working with Microsoft software since NT 4.0 and Windows 95. So, yeahâ€¦ that old. ðŸ˜Š

I'm an Microsoft Intune and Identity & Access MVP, Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT). I live in Nieuwkoop, the Netherlands. Specialized in Microsoft Intune,  Entra ID, Microsoft 365, and Windows clients.

In 2020, my first book came available at Packt. It's a Microsoft Exam MD-100 Windows 10 Certification Guide and you can buy it in the links below.
Since 2022, I founded the bi-weekly Youtube show, called the WorkplaceDudes. I do this project with two of my colleagues.

In my free time, I'm hunting for some geocaches around the Netherlands and beyond the borders with my girlfriend and daughter and other geocache-friends.

My interests are especially Microsoft technologies. I am also interested in photography, summer holidays, wintersport, and social media.

If youâ€™d like to get in touch, feel free to say hello through any of the social links.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeroen Burgerhout, a 44-year-old Microsoft enthusiast with a deep-seated passion for technology. 

In my professional life, I serve as a Microsoft 365 Consultant and Microsoft Certified Trainer, based in the beautiful town of Nieuwkoop, Netherlands. I have over 20 years of experience primarily with Microsoft products, which allows me to bring a wealth of knowledge to my roles. I specialize in Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft 365, Windows client, MDM, and MAM. My career has led me to work on Modern Workplace projects across a multitude of different industries. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to help businesses leverage the power of Microsoft's suite of products to improve their operations. 

Beyond my regular workdays, I take pride in giving back to the tech community. I host a bi-weekly show, [WorkplaceDudes](https://workplacedudes.nl), where I share insights and trends related to the modern workplace. I also co-host the [Microsoft 365 Modern Management Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-CBD-Microsoft-Modern-Management-Meetup/), a platform that brings together like-minded professionals to discuss the latest in Microsoft 365 management. I'm an active participant in [Experts Live Netherlands](https://www.expertslive.nl), where I sit on the Program Panel and serve as the Speaker Manager. 

In 2020, I embarked on a new journey as an author. My first book, Microsoft Exam MD-100 Windows 10 Certification Guide, is now available. Writing this guide was a fulfilling experience as it allowed me to share my knowledge on a larger scale. If you'd like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out. 

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
